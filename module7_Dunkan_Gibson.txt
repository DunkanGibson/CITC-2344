1.  The persistence of values for global constructs contributes to processing efficiency by enabling the value to persist throughout the users session. 
	This reduces the data retrival proccessing and thus rasing processing efficiency.

2.  The concept of overloading enables the capability to use the same name for multiple program units in the same package. 
	It is used because it enables you to create two procedures in a package with the same name and function and have two seperate parameter data types.

3.  You may have a package specification without a body because it is often used as a mechanism for holding static data values that are commonly used in programs.
	Using this mechanism instead of performing a database query can improve processing efficiency.

4.  A private package construct is one that it can be called only by other program units in the same package thus limiting its visibility scope.

5.  (a)  There are 2 functions and 2 procedures in the block.
	(b)  There are no cursors in the block.
	(c)  There are 2 exception handling areas in the block.
	(d)  The name of the table referred to in the block is bb_basket
	
6.  (a)  A cursor and a function are declared in the package specification.
	(b)  The information you can get from the function ck_tax_pp is the tax rate based on the state you input.
	(c)  The name of the table referred to in the block is bb_tax.
	(d)  DECLARE
			lv_state_tax NUMBER(6, 2);
		BEGIN
			lv_state_tax := tax_pkg.ck_tax_pp('TN');
			DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(lv_state_tax);
