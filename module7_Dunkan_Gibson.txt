1.  The persistence of values for global constructs contributes to processing efficiency by enabling the value to persist throughout the users session. 
	This reduces the data retrival proccessing and thus rasing processing efficiency.

2.  The concept of overloading enables the capability to use the same name for multiple program units in the same package. 
	It is used because it enables you to create two procedures in a package with the same name and function and have two seperate parameter data types.

3.  You may have a package specification without a body because it is often used as a mechanism for holding static data values that are commonly used in programs.
	Using this mechanism instead of performing a database query can improve processing efficiency.

4.  A private package construct is one that it can be called only by other program units in the same package thus limiting its visibility scope.
