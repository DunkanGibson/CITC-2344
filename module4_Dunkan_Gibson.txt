1. The difference between implicit and explicit cursors is that implicit cursors are declared automatically for all
DML and SELECT statements issued in a PL/SQL block. Compared to explicit cursors which are declared and
manipulated in PL/SQL code for handling rows returned by a SELECT statement.

2. The purpose of exception handlers is to provide a mechanism for trapping an error that occurs in processing. Its
code handles the error in a user-friendly manner and allows the application to continue.

3. Study the following block, and answer the questions below:
	(a) What type of cursor is used in the block?
	(b) What is the name of the cursor?
	(c) What are the names of the tables referred in the block?
	(d) What situation causes the loop stops looping immediately?
	DECLARE
		CURSOR cur_basket IS
			SELECT bi.idBasket, bi.quantity, p.stock
			FROM bb_basketitem bi INNER JOIN bb_product p
			USING (idProduct)
			WHERE bi.idBasket = lv_bask_num;
	TYPE type_basket IS RECORD (
			basket bb_basketitem.idBasket%TYPE,
			qty bb_basketitem.quantity%TYPE,
			stock bb_product.stock%TYPE);
		rec_basket type_basket;
		lv_bask_num bb_basketitem.idBasket%TYPE := 6;
		lv_flag_txt CHAR(1) := 'Y';
	BEGIN
		OPEN cur_basket;
		LOOP
			FETCH cur_basket INTO rec_basket;
			EXIT WHEN cur_basket%NOTFOUND;
			IF rec_basket.stock < rec_basket.qty
				THEN lv_flag_txt := 'N';
			END IF;
		END LOOP;
			CLOSE cur_basket;
			IF lv_flag_txt = 'Y' THEN
				DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('All items in stock!');
			END IF;
			IF lv_flag_txt = 'N' THEN
				DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('All items NOT in stock!');
				END IF;
		END;
		
4. Study the following block, and answer the questions below:
