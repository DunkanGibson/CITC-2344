1. The difference between implicit and explicit cursors is that implicit cursors are declared automatically for all
DML and SELECT statements issued in a PL/SQL block. Compared to explicit cursors which are declared and
manipulated in PL/SQL code for handling rows returned by a SELECT statement.

2. The purpose of exception handlers is to provide a mechanism for trapping an error that occurs in processing. Its
code handles the error in a user-friendly manner and allows the application to continue.

3. 	(a) The type of cursor used in the block is explicit.
	(b) The name of the cursor is cur_basket
	(c) The names of the tables referred in the block are bb_basketitem and bb_product
	(d) The situation that causes the loop to stop looping immediately is when cur_basket%NOTFOUND is evaluated as true.
		
4. 	(a) A user defined exception is handled in the block.
	(b) The name of the exception is ex_update.
	(c) The exception is caused when the implicit cursor determies that no rows were altered by the update statement.
	(d) The output when the exception happens is "valid original basket ID".
	
5.	(a) An undefined exception is handled in the block.
	(b) The number-2290 is an Oracle error number. It is typically determined via testing which helps develop a list of potential Oracle errors that the SQL statement
		could generate.
