1. The fundamental differences between a program unit and a database
trigger is that procedures and functions are called specifically by name to run. A database trigger is fired
by an event, such as a DML statement: INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.

2. A compound trigger is a special trigger that was intorduced in Oracle 11g to resolve the mutationg table error. A compound trigger allows for the combining of  all four triggering events into a single trigger
object.

3. You can disable a trigger by using the ALTER TABLE statment and setting the trigger status to disable.

4. When an UPDATE statement is issued on the BB JUNK table, the first trigger, trig_1, fires
first.

5. The existing triggers for bb junk are deleted after running the statement.
