1.  Variables are named memory areas that hold values so that they can be
	retrieved and manipulated in programs.
	
2.  The three main types of loop structures in PL/SQL are basic, WHILE, and FOR. 

		A basic loop uses the LOOP and END LOOP markers to begin and end the loop code, which
		includes statements to be repeated. It also includes an EXIT WHEN clause condition that evaluates to TRUE at some point, which serves as the instruction to stop the
		loop.
		
		A WHILE loop includes a condition to check at
		the top of the loop in the LOOP clause. For each iteration of the loop, this condition is
		checked, and if it’s TRUE, the loop continues.
		
		A FOR loop performs the same job of iterating; except, this type of loop indicates how
		many times to loop by including a range in the statement.

3.  The two types of decision structures in PL/SQL are IF-THEN and CASE.

4.  Flowcharts help developers map out the sequence of events to be coded in a clear and concise visual representation.

5.  When a CONSTANT option is set in a variable declaration it is used to to enforce that the value can’t be
changed in the block.

6.  Observe the following block and tell the number of times theFORloop executes.
	DECLARE
		lv_cnt_num NUMBER(3);
	BEGIN
		FOR i IN 1..7 LOOP
			lv_cnt_num := lv_cnt_num + 2;
		END LOOP;
	END;
	
7.  Observe the following block and tell the output.
	DECLARE
		lv_flag_txt CHAR(1) := 'X';
		lv_amt_num NUMBER(4,2);
	BEGIN
		CASE lv_flag_txt
			WHEN 'A' THEN lv_amt_num := 14.15;
			WHEN 'E' THEN lv_amt_num := 10.05;
			ELSE lv_amt_num := 12.25;
		END CASE;
		DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(lv_amt_num);
	END;
	
	8.  Observe the following block and find the syntax errors.
	DECLARE
		lv_junk1 CHAR(1) := 'X';
		lv_junk2 CHAR(1) := 'Y';
	BEGIN
		lv_junk1 = 'N';
		DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(lv_junk2)
	END;
