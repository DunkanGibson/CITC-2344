an application server, also referred to as the middle tier.

3.  A user interface are the windows displayed to users to enter information or take actions, such as clicking a button. The role a procedural language plays in user interfaces is providing the processing to verify info has been
entered as well as transmitting requests, such as an SQL statement to query requested data, to the database server.

4.  Select DISTINCT(i.idproduct) 
    FROM bb_basketitem i INNER JOIN bb_basket b
        USING(idbasket)
        WHERE b.orderplaced = 1
		ORDER BY i.idproduct

5.Select idproduct, productname, price
    FROM bb_product
    WHERE type = 'C'
    GROUP BY idproduct, productname, price
    HAVING price > (
        SELECT AVG(price)
        FROM bb_product
        WHERE type = 'C'
    )
