1.  The %TYPE attribute is used in the variable declaration to provide the data type. The reason it is used is that it tells the system
to look up a database columnâ€™s data type and use it for the declared variable. This is very advantageous because it means you don't have to go and look up what data type a coulum is and it also reduce code maintainence.

2.  The %ROWTYPE attribute is used to declare a record when you want to return most or all of the columns of a row from a table. The reason you would do this is that doing so with %TYPE could get very cumbersome. It works similarly to %TYPE in that it determines the needed data type by referencing a database table structure. This attribute also goes a step further and
reviews the table structure for all column names and data types and creates the record data type based on this information.

3.  (a)  Five variables are declared lv_qty_num, lv_amt_num, lv_price_num, lv_prod_num, lv_tot_num 
	(b)  Technically only 1 variable type, number, is used with two other variables using anchored data types that happen to also be number.
	(c)  The WHILE loop repeats 3 times.
	(d)  What the outputs are qty = 3 and amount = 85.5 

	
4. (a)  Three variables are declared.
   (b)  Technically only 1 variable type, number, is used with one other variable using anchored data type that happens to also be number.
   (c)  If lv_qty_num has a value of 20, the outputs are qty = 20 shipping = 12
   (d)  If lv_qty_num has a value of 5, the outputs are qty = 5 shipping = 7.5


5. (a)  The data type of recbasket is record.
   (b)  The name of the table referred to in the block is bb_basket.
   (c)  The Total column in bb_basket has the same type as that of sub, which is number.
   (d)  This block creates a recod to hold values from 5 different columns from the bb_basket table. It then grabs these values from the table using the lv_bask_num to specify what basket to grab from and displays the results.
