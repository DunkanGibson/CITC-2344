1. Formal Parameters are listed in a program unit as place holders for real values that will be input. Whereas Actual Parameters are the arguments used when calling the program unit.

2. The difference between passing parameter values by reference and by value is that when you pass by reference a pointer to the value in the actual parameter is created. Instead of copying the
value from the actual parameter to the formal parameter which would be passing by value.

3. The difference between using a RETURN statement in a function and a procedure is that in a function it is used to indicate a value that is returned by the function. Whereas in a procedure a return statement is used to control the flow of execution.

4. Two requirements that must be met for a function to be used in an SQL statement are it must be a row function, not a group function and returned value data types must be a database data type.

5.  (a) The name of the function is status_desc_sf
	(b) The type that is returned by the function is VARCHAR2
	(c) Create a SQL statement that uses the function.

6.  (a) The name of the table referred to in the block is dd_pledge.
	(b) The parameter of the function is the same as that of the idstatus column in table dd.pledge.
	(c) The mode of the parameter in the function is IN.
	(d) Create a SQL statement that uses the function.
